# PCD2020 – p5.js Shaders
Workshop by Lena Frei + Alain Brusch for the [basel.codes PCD2020](https://basel.codes/2020)

## Getting Started
We'll be using [P5LIVE](https://p5live.org) editor. 

For the workshop, feel free to use [P5LIVE online](https://p5live.org) (runs best in Chrome or Firefox).  
Eventually you should install it locally for running as an [offline server](https://github.com/ffd8/P5LIVE#offline-server) (no internet needed!).

## Workshop TOC
1. Introduction to shaders and GLSL
2. Writing simple vertex and fragment shaders in p5live
3. Short break
4. Using more complicated functions for more interesting outcomes
